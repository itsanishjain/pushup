# PassPort - The App for Learner Drivers

## How I Got the Idea
My friend Peter mentioned something interesting—there's an app in the US that helps learner drivers, but nothing like it in the UK. When you're learning to drive here, you can practice in your own car, but only if someone with a full license (for at least three years) sits with you. The problem? Not everyone has a family member or friend available.

That's when I thought: why not build an app that connects learner drivers with people willing to just sit in the car with them? Not instructors—just someone who meets the legal requirement so learners can practice whenever they want. And they can pay the passenger for their time. Simple.

## Why a Mini App?
Distribution is the hardest part of launching any app. I've seen this firsthand running my own software product. Mini apps solve this by tapping into existing platforms with millions of users. They already have traction, which means we don’t have to struggle with the classic marketplace chicken-and-egg problem.

With a standalone app, we’d need massive infrastructure, government compliance layers, and KYC solutions just to prove drivers are real. `Traditional solutions are Band-aid solutions as Anay said` verification don’t scale well. But the team at World is working on solving this, and with their support, this idea is now executable.

## Why This Matters
I believe in the Pudgy Penguins approach—consumer apps that grow through social backing are key for Web3 adoption. This is my contribution to that vision. The internet is full of bots, and current KYC and Captcha solutions are just Band-aid fixes that hurt user experience. We need something better.

With World’s tech and a mini app model, we have a shot at making this work. Right now, similar platforms are pulling in 300K-500K users per week. That’s the kind of engine we need to make this a reality.

## What’s Next?
This is a hackathon build, but the plan is real. If we get this right, learner drivers in the UK will finally have an easy way to practice without relying on friends or family.

Let’s make it happen.
